\section{Introduction}
 
 
In this project our aim was to improve the way the robots are playing football together. Until then, each robot had its own view/opinion of the surrounding field and so was able to make decisions only due to this information. Our idea was to build an intern team communication system, that provides one robots information for every team member. Thus a form of swarm intelligence could increase the quality of the robots   acting together as a whole team. Considering that, it was necessary to develop a world model to make the information transfomable, unique and easy to provide. Furthermore we detected, that the image prosessing quality was not good enough to precisly determine the robots position and so we did some vision modifications and added some filters. 


Outline of underlying concepts

Brief summary of relevant theoretical background knowledge

Review of existing (published) work relevant for your topic(s)

Motivate the reader for the issue(s) you are trying to solve

Explain why your work (your approach) is necessary
\subsection{Motivation}
Obstacle recognition and dynamis behaviour towards this is very important if several robots shall act together in a certain way. One of the main reasons for this is to avoid the physical contact between robots. As long as their hardware is not good enough to hold balance when beeing touched, they are very likely to fall and - in worst-case-scenario - bring about anothers robots downfall. This usually causes hight costs for hardware fixes and also disturbs the gameplay. Getting up again can take several seconds and toward the opposite robots it is not within the meaning of fairplay.
Besides more and especially better knowledge about the surroundings is strategically important in the RoboCup competition. Having a reliably prospect of its own positions, the position of the ball and the opposites robots position combined with a good path finding algorithm can raise the number of scores significantly.

\subsection{Problem}
\subsubsection{Vision}
When we checked how good the already implemented algorithm worked we discovered, that ot even the goals were recognized suffinciently. The kind of jumoed from one point to the other and most of the time their were more than two goal postst recognized fo one goal. In addition obstacles at least could be recognise, but there was no behaviour to react in a senseful way. Moreover it was no possible for the robot to distinguish between obstacles, such as team mate or opposite player.

\paragraph{Notes and Comments.}
The first results on subharmonics were
obtained by Foster and Kesselman in \cite{fos:kes}, who showed the existence of
infinitely many subharmonics both in the subquadratic and superquadratic
case, with suitable growth conditions on $H'$. Again the duality
approach enabled Foster and Waterman in \cite{fos:kes:2} to treat the
same problem in the convex-subquadratic case, with growth conditions on
$H$ only.

Recently, Smith and Waterman (see \cite{smit:wat} and May et al. \cite{mes})
have obtained lower bound on the number of subharmonics of period $kT$,
based on symmetry considerations and on pinching estimates, as in
Sect.~5.2 of this article.
